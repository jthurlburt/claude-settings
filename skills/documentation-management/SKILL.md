# Documentation Management

## Overview

Systematically update project documentation to match code reality. Analyze changes, identify affected documentation, and update all relevant files maintaining consistency across README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and guides.

## When to Use

- After implementing features
- After fixing bugs
- After refactoring or architecture changes
- When documentation is outdated across multiple files
- Before creating pull requests

## Core Approach

**Analyze changes → Identify affected docs → Update systematically → Verify consistency**

1. **Understand scope**: Analyze code changes from conversation or codebase comparison
2. **Read all docs**: Use Glob to find markdown files, Read each documentation file completely
3. **Identify gaps**: Compare implementation vs documentation (new features, changed APIs, removed functionality)
4. **Update comprehensively**: Modify all affected docs, not just README

## Documentation Modes

**Overview mode** (when starting): Glob markdown files, read each, present summary with gaps

**Sync mode** (during work): Update docs incrementally, CHANGELOG with changes, README for features

**Session mode** (after coding): Review conversation, group by type (Added, Fixed, Changed), update all affected docs

## Update Patterns by Change Type

| Change Type         | Documentation Updates                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New feature**     | README features, CHANGELOG (minor bump), API docs, usage examples       |
| **Bug fix**         | CHANGELOG (patch bump), troubleshooting if significant                  |
| **Refactoring**     | Architecture docs, migration guide if breaking, CHANGELOG               |
| **Security fix**    | Security policy, CHANGELOG with Security section, README if user-facing |
| **Performance**     | Benchmarks, CHANGELOG with improved metrics, optimization guides        |
| **Breaking change** | CHANGELOG (major bump), migration guide, README with upgrade path       |

## CHANGELOG Version Guidance

Suggest version bumps following semver:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes, API removals, incompatible modifications
- **MINOR**: New features, enhancements, deprecations (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, internal changes

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):

- Group by type: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Newest entries at top
- Link to issues/PRs when available

## Essential Rules

**ALWAYS:**

- Read existing docs completely before updates
- Find exact section needing update, modify in-place
- Preserve custom content and existing formatting
- Match project's documentation style and conventions
- Update all affected files, not just one
- Include inline source links for factual claims: `[claim](https://source.url)`. Unverified claims are unverifiable

**NEVER:**

- Delete existing documentation
- Overwrite custom sections (respect `<!-- CUSTOM:START -->` markers)
- Change documentation style drastically
- Add AI attribution or Claude Code markers
- Create unnecessary new documentation files

## Documentation Types

- **README**: Features, setup, usage, architecture
- **CHANGELOG**: Version history with categorized changes
- **API docs**: Endpoints, parameters, responses
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, settings
- **Guides**: Architecture, deployment, troubleshooting, migration

## Completion

Ask how to proceed: update all, focus on specific files, create missing docs, or generate migration guide. Maintain documentation as current as code.
