# Predict Issues

## Overview

Proactive problem identification prevents issues before they impact projects. Analyze codebases for patterns that commonly lead to problems, assess risk systematically, and provide actionable recommendations with priority levels.

## When to Use

- After implementing features
- Before deployment
- During architecture reviews
- When evaluating technical decisions
- During code reviews for new functionality

## Risk Assessment Framework

Evaluate each potential issue across four dimensions:

| Dimension      | Assessment                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Likelihood** | How probable is this issue? Consider code patterns, usage patterns, scale trends |
| **Impact**     | How severe would consequences be? Downtime, data loss, security breach, poor UX  |
| **Timeline**   | When might this become a problem? Immediate, weeks, months, at 10x scale         |
| **Effort**     | How hard to fix now vs later? Technical debt cost, refactoring complexity        |

## Security-Specific Risk Analysis

When analyzing potential security issues:

### Additional Risk Dimensions

- **Exploitability**: How easily can this be exploited? (trivial/moderate/difficult)
- **Exposure**: What's exposed? (credentials/data/system access)
- **Blast radius**: Impact if exploited? (single user/all users/system compromise)

### Common Security Anti-patterns to Check

1. **Credentials in code**: Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens
2. **Injection vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, command injection, XSS
3. **Broken authentication**: Weak session management, missing validation
4. **Insecure dependencies**: Known CVEs in dependencies
5. **Insufficient logging**: Can't detect or investigate incidents
6. **Missing input validation**: Trusting user input without sanitization

### Risk Scoring for Security Issues

```text
Security Risk = Exploitability × Exposure × Blast Radius

Examples:
- Hardcoded API key in public repo: 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.8 = 0.80 (CRITICAL)
- Missing input validation on admin endpoint: 0.7 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.57 (HIGH)
- Outdated dependency with theoretical vulnerability: 0.3 × 0.5 × 0.6 = 0.09 (LOW)
```

Prioritize by exploitability first, exposure second, blast radius third.

## Problem Categories

Focus analysis on these common categories:

**Performance**

- O(n²) algorithms that break at scale
- Memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Inefficient database queries (N+1, missing indexes)
- Unoptimized API calls

**Maintainability**

- High cyclomatic complexity
- Poor naming and unclear intent
- Tight coupling between components
- Code duplication across modules

**Security**

- Input validation gaps
- Exposed secrets or credentials
- Weak authentication patterns
- Missing authorization checks

**Scalability**

- Hardcoded limits and assumptions
- Single points of failure
- Stateful designs that don't scale horizontally
- Resource bottlenecks

## Analysis Process

1. **Identify risk areas**: Use Grep to find problematic patterns, Glob to analyze file structure growth, Read to examine complex functions
2. **Assess each issue**: Apply risk framework (likelihood × impact × timeline × effort)
3. **Prioritize findings**: Rank by risk level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. **Provide recommendations**: Specific, actionable fixes with effort estimates

## Output Format

For each prediction:

- **Location**: Specific file and line references (e.g., [auth.ts:42](auth.ts#L42))
- **Problem**: What pattern will cause issues and why
- **Risk assessment**: Likelihood, impact, timeline, effort to fix
- **Recommendation**: Concrete steps to prevent the problem
- **Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low based on risk dimensions

## Common Patterns to Check

**Complexity hotspots**

- Functions over 50 lines
- Files with high change frequency
- Deep nesting levels (>3)

**Performance concerns**

- Nested loops over collections
- Synchronous operations in critical paths
- Missing pagination for list operations

**Architecture stress points**

- Circular dependencies
- God objects with too many responsibilities
- Integration points without error handling

**Technical debt indicators**

- TODO/FIXME comments accumulating
- Commented-out code blocks
- Temporary workarounds still present

## Tracking Predictions

After analysis, ask user how to track findings:

- **Memory**: Store risk assessments for future reference using remember()
- **TodoWrite**: Create structured task list for systematic review
- **Summary only**: Provide report without creating tasks

Avoid AI attribution, Claude Code watermarks, or assistant signatures in issues or reports.
