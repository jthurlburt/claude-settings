## Evaluation Summary

**Evaluated:** 2025-10-22

**Commands evaluated:** 13 of 24 (Tier 1, Tier 2, and selected additional)

**Results:**

**Integrated as Skills (3):**
- documentation-management (from docs.md) - Holistic documentation management across README, CHANGELOG, API docs
- predict-issues (from predict-issues.md) - Proactive problem identification with risk assessment
- code-and-project-cleanup (from remove-comments.md + cleanproject.md) - Unified code and project cleanup

**Concepts Extracted for Enhancement (9):**
- implement - External source adaptation, pattern matching, smart repo sampling, dependency resolution
- refactor - Continuous validation, de-para mapping, auto-fix broken references, pattern migration tracking
- contributing - Automatic issue discovery, context detection, mandatory pre-flight checks, PR style matching
- test - Auto-fix patterns for test failures, log/console pattern detection, context-aware test selection
- scaffold - Pattern discovery from codebase, convention replication
- security-scan - Multi-dimensional vulnerability assessment, risk-based prioritization, threat analysis patterns
- understand - 5-phase discovery process, technology stack detection, pattern recognition
- commit - Pre-commit quality gates, commit message generation from change analysis

**Rejected (2):**
- todos-to-issues - GitHub-specific utility automation, not teachable technique
- review - Redundant with existing code review infrastructure

**Not Evaluated (11 Tier 4 commands):**
Simple wrappers or minimal functionality not selected for deep evaluation.

**Key Innovation Patterns Identified:**
- Session state pattern (plan.md + state.json) - noted but not adopted due to complexity
- Deep validation with behavior preservation - concepts extracted
- Context detection and adaptation - concepts extracted
- Pre-flight checks as mandatory gates - concepts extracted
- Automatic issue discovery via remote scanning - concepts extracted
- Extended thinking for complex analysis - observed in multiple commands

**Conclusion:**
CCPlugins contains valuable workflow concepts, particularly around safety gates, context awareness, and proactive analysis. While most commands were too heavyweight for direct integration (session state management), core concepts significantly enhance existing superpowers workflows. Three commands converted to skills fill clear gaps in documentation management, predictive analysis, and cleanup.
