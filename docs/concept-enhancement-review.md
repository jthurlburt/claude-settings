# Concept Enhancement Review

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Purpose**: Comprehensive review of 12 proposed skill enhancements from extracted concepts
**Source**: docs/concept-to-skill-mapping.md

---

## Review Process

For each enhancement, I've evaluated:
1. **Concept quality**: Is the extracted concept accurate and valuable?
2. **Target skill fit**: Does it naturally belong in the target skill?
3. **Enhancement text quality**: Is the proposed text well-written and actionable?
4. **Integration approach**: Where exactly should it go in the target skill?
5. **Potential conflicts**: Does it contradict existing content?

---

## HIGH PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. External Source Adaptation → brainstorming ✅ APPROVED

**Source**: CCPlugins/implement.md (Smart Implementation Engine)
**Concept**: GitHub URLs/docs pattern matching, smart repo sampling, source-analysis.md artifact

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - implement.md has comprehensive external source handling (lines 34-110)
- ✅ Fits brainstorming perfectly - Phase 1 (Understanding) often references external examples
- ✅ Enhancement text is clear and actionable
- ⚠️ Minor issue: "Reference Analysis" phase name might confuse with existing phases

**Recommendation**: APPROVE with modification
- Insert after Phase 1, before Phase 2 as "Phase 1.5: Working with External References (when applicable)"
- Integrate naturally into brainstorming flow as conditional step
- Keep concise - brainstorming skill is already comprehensive

**Integration Point**: After line 46 in brainstorming/SKILL.md (after Phase 1 section)

**Revised Enhancement Text**:
```markdown
### Phase 1.5: Working with External References (when applicable)

If your partner references external code, repos, or patterns during understanding:

**Smart Sampling Strategy:**
- Focus on tests (reveals behavior), core modules (shows patterns), README (architecture)
- Don't read everything - sample strategically

**Pattern Extraction:**
- What conventions does it follow?
- What problems does it solve?
- What design decisions did they make?

**Context Mapping:**
- How does their context differ from ours?
- What translates directly?
- What needs adaptation?

**Document Insights:**
- Create `docs/plans/<date>-<topic>-reference-analysis.md` if substantial
- Capture key learnings that inform our design

Don't copy blindly. Understand, extract, adapt.
```

---

### 2. Continuous Validation → executing-plans ✅ APPROVED

**Source**: CCPlugins/refactor.md (Intelligent Refactoring Engine)
**Concept**: Validate after EVERY change, de-para mapping, auto-fix broken references

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - refactor.md lines 143-175 show comprehensive validation
- ✅ Fits executing-plans perfectly - addresses gap in current process
- ✅ Enhancement adds critical safety without bloat
- ✅ De-para concept is valuable but might be overkill for all plans

**Recommendation**: APPROVE with simplification
- Keep validation-after-each-task concept
- Simplify de-para to "track breaking changes"
- Make it practical for typical plan execution

**Integration Point**: After Step 2 (Execute Batch) in executing-plans/SKILL.md, around line 30

**Revised Enhancement Text**:
```markdown
### Within-Batch Validation

After EACH task in a batch (before marking complete):

1. **Quick Checks**:
   - Type check if applicable (`mypy`, `tsc`, etc.)
   - Imports resolve (no broken references)
   - Basic smoke test (if specified in task)

2. **Breaking Changes**:
   - If you changed function signatures, grep for call sites
   - If you renamed modules, check imports
   - Document any breaking changes for later

3. **Fix Forward**:
   - Validation fails → Fix immediately
   - Don't accumulate validation debt
   - Each task leaves codebase in valid state

**Exception**: Refactors that intentionally break across multiple tasks - document the plan, validate at batch boundary.
```

---

### 3. Pre-commit Quality Gates → verification-before-completion ✅ APPROVED

**Source**: CCPlugins/commit.md (Smart Git Commit)
**Concept**: MUST run build/test/lint before commit, quality gates checklist

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - commit.md lines 5-10 show pre-commit checks
- ✅ Fits verification-before-completion perfectly - spec skill already exists for this purpose
- ✅ Enhancement makes abstract principle concrete
- ✅ Examples with actual commands are extremely valuable

**Recommendation**: APPROVE as-is
- Enhancement text in mapping doc is excellent
- Adds concrete "how" to existing "why"
- No conflicts with existing content

**Integration Point**: After "Common Failures" table in verification-before-completion/SKILL.md, around line 50

**Enhancement Text**: Use exactly as written in concept-to-skill-mapping.md lines 306-361

---

## MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 4. Auto-fix Patterns → systematic-debugging ✅ APPROVED with EXPANSION

**Source**: CCPlugins/test.md (Smart Test Runner)
**Concept**: Common test failure patterns (async/timing, mocks, imports)

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - test.md lines 69-84 show pattern recognition
- ✅ Fits systematic-debugging well - currently lacks test-specific patterns
- ✅ Enhancement text is good but could be expanded
- ✅ Complements Phase 2 (Pattern Analysis) perfectly

**Recommendation**: APPROVE with expansion
- Add to Phase 2 as "Common Test Failure Patterns" subsection
- Expand with more patterns from test.md
- Keep systematic approach focus

**Integration Point**: Within Phase 2 (Pattern Analysis) of systematic-debugging/SKILL.md, after line 145

**Revised Enhancement Text**:
```markdown
#### Common Test Failure Patterns

When debugging test failures, check these patterns BEFORE diving deep:

**Async/Timing Issues**
- **Symptom**: Test passes sometimes, fails sometimes (flaky)
- **Check**: Are you awaiting all promises? Using proper async test syntax?
- **Pattern**: Missing `await`, forgotten `async`, race conditions
- **Fix**: Add awaits, use condition-based waiting (not arbitrary timeouts)
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use superpowers:condition-based-waiting for proper async testing

**Mock/Stub Issues**
- **Symptom**: "X is not a function" or unexpected values returned
- **Check**: Are mocks properly set up? Restored between tests?
- **Pattern**: Mock not matching real signature, stale mocks, improper cleanup
- **Fix**: Match real signatures, use beforeEach/afterEach, verify mock calls
- **WARNING**: See testing-anti-patterns skill - don't test mock behavior

**Import Issues**
- **Symptom**: "Cannot find module" or wrong module loaded
- **Check**: Import paths correct? Module resolution working?
- **Pattern**: Relative vs absolute imports, circular dependencies, missing __init__.py
- **Fix**: Consistent import style, break circular deps, check module structure

**Flaky Tests**
- **Symptom**: Test fails in CI but passes locally (or vice versa)
- **Check**: Environment dependencies? Timing assumptions? Test isolation?
- **Pattern**: Hardcoded paths, timezone dependencies, shared state between tests
- **Fix**: Use fixtures for paths, explicit timezone handling, proper test isolation

**Build/Compilation Failures** (from test.md lines 53-67)
- **Symptom**: Tests won't even run
- **Check**: Does project build? Console output for compilation errors?
- **Pattern**: Missing dependencies, version conflicts, build config issues
- **Fix**: Verify build passes BEFORE running tests

These patterns accelerate Phase 1 (Root Cause) by catching common issues quickly.
```

### 5. Vulnerability Assessment → predict-issues ✅ APPROVED

**Source**: CCPlugins/security-scan.md (Security Analysis)
**Concept**: Multi-dimensional security analysis, risk-based prioritization

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - security-scan.md lines 59-74 show comprehensive security assessment
- ✅ Fits predict-issues perfectly - security is a problem category
- ✅ Enhancement adds valuable security-specific lens
- ✅ Risk scoring formula is concrete and actionable

**Recommendation**: APPROVE as-is
- Insert after "Problem Categories" section
- Keeps predict-issues skill focused but adds security depth
- Examples are concrete and helpful

**Integration Point**: After "Problem Categories" section in predict-issues/SKILL.md, around line 58

**Enhancement Text**: Use exactly as written in concept-to-skill-mapping.md lines 222-253

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 6. Pattern Discovery → writing-plans ✅ APPROVED with INTEGRATION

**Source**: CCPlugins/scaffold.md (Intelligent Scaffolding)
**Concept**: Analyze codebase to understand conventions, replicate existing patterns

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - scaffold.md lines 40-50 show pattern discovery
- ✅ Fits writing-plans well - plans should reference existing patterns
- ✅ Enhancement text is good
- ⚠️ Potential overlap with existing "assume zero context" principle

**Recommendation**: APPROVE with clarification
- Make it explicit this is FOR the plan writer, not assuming engineer knows
- Pattern survey informs HOW you write the plan
- Keep concise - writing-plans is already dense

**Integration Point**: Before "Bite-Sized Task Granularity" in writing-plans/SKILL.md, around line 20

**Revised Enhancement Text**:
```markdown
## Pattern Survey (Before Writing Plan)

Before writing tasks, understand existing conventions so your plan follows them:

**Find Similar Features**:
- Search for existing implementations similar to what you're planning
- Use Grep for patterns, Glob for file structure

**Extract Patterns**:
- File organization (where do similar files live?)
- Naming conventions (how are similar classes/functions named?)
- Testing patterns (how are similar features tested?)
- Import patterns (how are dependencies imported?)

**Document in Plan**:
- Include "Existing Patterns" section in plan header
- Reference specific examples: "Follow UserService pattern (src/services/user.ts)"
- Ensures engineer follows project conventions even with zero context

**Example**:
```
## Existing Patterns
- Services: src/services/{feature}-service.ts, class {Feature}Service
- Tests: tests/{feature}-service.test.ts, describe('{Feature}Service')
- Imports: Relative for local, absolute from 'src/' for cross-module
```

Pattern consistency makes the codebase learnable. Plans should preserve patterns.
```

### 7. Proactive Issue Discovery → requesting-code-review ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Source**: CCPlugins/contributing.md (Complete Contribution Strategy)
**Concept**: Scan remote repo for matching issues, smart matching algorithm

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - contributing.md lines 148-194 show issue discovery
- ⚠️ Target skill mismatch - requesting-code-review is about dispatching code-reviewer agent
- ❌ Enhancement text assumes different workflow than current skill
- ❌ Contributing.md is about GitHub workflow, code review is about quality

**Recommendation**: REJECT for this target, propose alternative
- Concept is valuable but wrong target skill
- Should go in finishing-a-development-branch skill (Step 3.5 before presenting options)
- Or create new "preparing-to-contribute" skill

**Alternative**: Add to finishing-a-development-branch as "Pre-PR Checks"

---

### 8. Progressive Reasoning Framework → brainstorming ⚠️ NEEDS SIMPLIFICATION

**Source**: claude-codex-settings/update-pr-summary.md (PR Summary)
**Concept**: Multi-lens categorization, steel man reasoning, bias detection

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - update-pr-summary.md lines 20-144 show comprehensive framework
- ⚠️ Target fit questionable - brainstorming already has rigorous process
- ⚠️ Enhancement text adds significant complexity
- ⚠️ Multi-lens, steel man, bias checks might be overkill for design

**Recommendation**: SIMPLIFY dramatically or REJECT
- Core value: "Challenge your assumptions" is good
- But full progressive reasoning framework is too heavyweight
- Steel man and bias detection might work, rest is excessive

**Revised Minimal Enhancement** (if approved):
```markdown
### Phase 3.5: Challenge Your Design (before finalization)

Before exiting brainstorming, stress-test your design:

**Steel Man the Alternatives**:
- What's the BEST argument for approaches you rejected?
- Could you defend those approaches?

**Bias Check**:
- Favoring this because it's familiar? Trendy? Comfortable?
- What would a skeptic question?

**Alternative Perspectives**:
- **Operations**: "How do I debug this in production?"
- **Future maintainer**: "How do I modify this in 6 months?"
- **Security**: "How could this be exploited?"

If you can't defend your design against these challenges, return to exploration.
```

**Integration Point**: After Phase 3, before Phase 4 in brainstorming/SKILL.md

---

### 9. Documentation Synchronization → finishing-a-development-branch ✅ APPROVED

**Source**: claude-codex-settings/pr-manager.md (PR Manager Agent)
**Concept**: Review diff to identify affected docs, update before PR

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - pr-manager.md lines 27-29 show doc sync
- ✅ Fits finishing-a-development-branch perfectly - Step 1.5 before presenting options
- ✅ Enhancement text is clear and actionable
- ✅ Addresses real gap - docs often forgotten

**Recommendation**: APPROVE as-is
- Insert after Step 1 (Verify Tests), before Step 2 (Determine Base Branch)
- Makes docs check explicit in finishing process

**Integration Point**: After Step 1 in finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md, around line 40

**Enhancement Text**: Use exactly as written in concept-to-skill-mapping.md lines 419-435

---

### 10. Pattern Alignment → receiving-code-review ✅ APPROVED

**Source**: claude-codex-settings/code-simplifier.md (Contextual Pattern Analyzer)
**Concept**: Search codebase for similar implementations before implementing feedback

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - code-simplifier.md lines 16-32 show pattern alignment
- ✅ Fits receiving-code-review well - adds proactive consistency check
- ✅ Enhancement text is practical
- ✅ Examples are concrete and helpful

**Recommendation**: APPROVE with minor edit
- Insert after "Source-Specific Handling" section
- Emphasize this is BEFORE implementing, not after

**Integration Point**: After "Source-Specific Handling" in receiving-code-review/SKILL.md, around line 100

**Enhancement Text**: Use as written in concept-to-skill-mapping.md lines 497-536, with one edit:
- Change section title to "Pattern Alignment Check (Before Implementation)"

---

## LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 11. Systematic Codebase Analysis → test-driven-development ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE FIT

**Source**: CCPlugins/understand.md (Understand Project)
**Concept**: 5-phase discovery process for unfamiliar codebases

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - understand.md shows systematic analysis
- ⚠️ Target fit weak - TDD is about RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- ⚠️ "Context gathering" pre-step dilutes TDD focus
- ⚠️ Enhancement might encourage skipping to implementation

**Recommendation**: REJECT for this target
- TDD skill should stay laser-focused on test-first discipline
- Context gathering is valuable but belongs elsewhere
- Could go in writing-plans or executing-plans as "Understanding Unfamiliar Code"

---

### 12. Multi-commit Splitting → finishing-a-development-branch ✅ APPROVED as OPTIONAL

**Source**: claude-codex-settings/commit-manager.md (Commit Manager Agent)
**Concept**: Determine logical commit groupings, precise file management

**Review**:
- ✅ Concept is accurate - commit-manager.md lines 24-50 show splitting strategy
- ✅ Fits finishing-a-development-branch as optional technique
- ✅ Enhancement text makes it clear this is optional
- ✅ Useful for specific situations, not universal

**Recommendation**: APPROVE as optional section
- Add as Step 2.5 "Optional: Clean Commit History"
- Make it clear when/why to use this
- Keep it concise

**Integration Point**: After Step 2 (Determine Base Branch) in finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md, around line 48

**Enhancement Text**: Use exactly as written in concept-to-skill-mapping.md lines 452-490

---

## REJECTED ENHANCEMENTS

### 13. Git Notes Retrospective Annotation - SKIP ❌

**Reason**: Too specialized, low ROI, git notes not widely adopted

### 14. Multi-level Changelog Framework - SKIP ❌

**Reason**: Too specific, most projects don't need multi-level changelogs
